      <h2>Design decisions</h2>
      <p>
        <em
          >Add a rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your
          particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What
          alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate
          choices? How does your design help the viewer reach the intended
          conclusions?</em
        >
        <br /><br />

        Initially, we planned on using some sort of scatter plot that would be
        toggled by a button to show the data throughout the years, but we
        would've had way to many tuples to chose from in our data set and
        would've made our visual "deceptive" in that sense. We chose our
        encoding to be a bar graph in order to portray our data in a simple and
        concise way for our User. We decided to make our x-axis quantitative so
        that we could clearly illustrate the year being referenced to since
        there's a natural sorting to the axis.<br /><br />

        We also have different graphs via our buttons to view additional data to
        give a better understanding of our question through multiple data
        points. This interaction technique is helpful in determining how the 3
        point shot has changed in the NBA because it allows us to compare these
        metrics, see changes, and make a conclusion from them. (more below) In
        addition to this, our color hue in a scheme that would give us a clean
        contrast. with our two color hues of #943d24 & #fffbf0 to give the User
        a soft/clean look at the data.<br /><br />

        If a user is a screen reader, the alt atttribute (code line: 52)
        specifies an alternative text that the potential user can use to discern
        abstractlly what our website regards.<br />

        <br />
        From our dataset, we filtered three metrics making sure that they were
        reliable in demonstrating and proving our intended conclusions regarding
        the increased utilization of the three pointer in the National Baketball
        Association. Futhermore, we wanted to highlight the slight rise in the
        accuracy NBA players possess when shooting three pointers these past 43
        years (3P%). We selected three pointers made, three pointers attempted,
        and three point percentages for the years 1979-2022. As noted, years
        represents our independent variable (x-axis) while each chosen metric
        was represented as a dependent variable (y-axis) in each respective tab
        in which a user can interact with (tab switching). These data-driven
        buttons allow a users to see our three chosen metrics in a interactive
        way to prove our arguments. <br />

        <br />
        Our visual aims at presenting audiences with the fact that the three
        point shot has gained popularity as we see in it's increased
        utilization. The bars act as reference points for a respective year and
        provide a comparison metric in it's height.

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <p>
        <em
          >Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a
          commentary on the development process, including answers to the
          following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing
          your application (in person-hours)? What aspects took the most
          time</em
        ><br /><br />

        We did this through pair programming via, liveshare so we both dabbled
        with the html,css,and js. The frontend was enjoyable because seeing your
        changes and making things look nice is always satisfying to the user &
        especially the implementer. The JS is where most of our debugging was
        taking place. This included trying to get get an element and having it
        function the way we wanted, and creating functions to help our html
        attributes work in sync.

        <br />

        <br />
        This assignment took approxiamtely 21 hours. The most time consuming
        aspect was figuring out how to peform d3 visualization customizations
        using javascript. Figuring out the exact attrbutes of our
        dataset/formulating a guiding question given a wide NBA database took
        the second most amount of time.
