# NBAnalysis

**NBAnalysis** is an interactive data visualization tool built with D3.js that explores the evolution of 3-point shooting in the NBA from 1979 to 2022. The project allows users to toggle between key metrics—**3-point attempts**, **3-point makes**, and **3-point percentage**—to analyze how the three-point shot has changed over time.


The NBA introduced the 3-point line in 1979, and its influence has grown dramatically in recent decades. This project was created to help users—casual fans, students, and data enthusiasts—understand the rising role of the 3-point shot using clean and accessible visual storytelling.


**Interactive Bar Chart**: Built with D3.js, allows users to toggle between three metrics:
  - `Three Point Attempts`
  - `Three Point Percentage`
  - `Three Pointers Made`


Technologies Used

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data binding and visualization
- HTML, CSS for layout and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interactivity


- Emphasize year-by-year comparisons
- Maintain visual clarity without clutter
- Let users intuitively grasp rising trends in attempts and makes

The toggling interaction allows viewers to explore the relationship between **volume** and **efficiency** of 3-point shooting across different eras.
